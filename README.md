# Project Overview

**Project 16x16** is a 2D platformer game made with **Java** and **processing** (processing is an open-source low-level animation and GUI library built on Java). It is an open-source project looking for people to make some awesome contributions. It was originally created by [Stephencraft](https://github.com/Stephcraft) and this repository contains the [latest source code](https://github.com/Stephcraft/Project-16x16), which will be worked on and modified by a group of five Temple University students as their final project of the CIS3296 class. Currently, the game lacks basic functionalities such as a proper setting interface for the user to do adjustments such as making keyboard and graphic changes, it also lacks an actual "play game" mode and the user interface is not friendly. Our goal is to make contributions to the current version by adding more useful features such as a story mode, more in-game items including traps, creative puzzle designs, and revise the UI to improve the user experience.

# Vision Statement

For essentially anyone from an elementary school student to a busy office worker who needs an enjoyable and visually appealing game to bring some fun to their day. Project 16x16 is an astonishing 2D platformer game with smooth gameplay mechanics as well as compelling story concepts, creative level designs, and magnificent soundtracks. Furthermore, it allows multi-players interaction so that you can play with friends to solve puzzles while advancing through different stages of the game. Unlike other products such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario, our game aims to bring smooth game mechanics and a cooperative environment together, making it a unique combination of multiplayer action games and multiplayer puzzle games. Gaming is often an entertainment and a hobby for people of different ages. The goal of Project 16x16 is to provide engaging gameplay that trains problem-solving and logic of the player, and to prompt teamwork and cooperation when played with others.
